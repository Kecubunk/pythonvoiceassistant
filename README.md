# pythonvoiceassistant
A simple start to a home voice assistant (like Alexa or Google Home). Using voice recognition and text to speech, this simple python bot kinda works.


It is still very much in development. Only some aspects work, and pretty much the whole thing is riddled with bugs and issues.

That said, it is a simple voice recognition assistant for others to work off of!
